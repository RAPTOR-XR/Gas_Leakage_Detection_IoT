# Gas Leakage Detection IoT
Industries, residential buildings, and gas-powered vehicles all struggle with gas leaks.
If the leak isnâ€™t discovered, it could explode, endanger lives, and harm the environment
severely. On-site alarms serve as a warning mechanism in the traditional leakage detection system. In this report, we suggest a technique for leakage detection in which
the user is additionally provided with wireless media access to the leakage information.
As a result, preventive measures are always taken right away, even when no one is
there. The NodeMCU ESP-12E and MQ-5 gas sensor are used by the detection system
to identify the leak and automatically send an email and a notification through WiFi.
The gas leakage detecting system prototype has been created and put to the test using
LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas). According to the trial findings, the system can find
the leak in less a minute.
